# Sentiment Analysis on Book Text File
This code reads a book text file and uses the NLTK library to analyze the sentiment of the text. It also uses the re library to find specific patterns in the text and removes stop words. It then counts the frequency of each word in the text, filters the results, and prints the top 5 most frequent words. Additionally, it calculates and prints the sentiment scores for each chapter in the book.
